Welcome! This tutorial guides you through building and deploying a full-stack serverless app with the Amplify Framework. 

We want you to feel empowered to build your own production-ready app with Amplify, so 
we're skipping "Hello World" in favor of an example that's closer to "Real
World", complete with authentication, data modeling, authorization, machine learning, CI/CD, testing, custom domain setup, and hosting.

Ready? Let's dive in!

## What we'll build

In this tutorial, we'll we'll use React to build a data-driven web app that lets users upload photos to secure photo galleries. We'll access our backend with a GraphQL API that fetches our data stored in a NoSQL database (Amazon DynamoDB). In addition, we'll demonstrate how to authenticate users, communicate with our API, and manage photo uploads. Finally, we add in AI-powered object tagging using Amazon Rekognition, allowing users to discover photos without any manual data entry.

<!-- Here's what the finished app will look like: -->
<!-- 
<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="../images/space-explorer.png" alt="Space explorer" width="400">
</div> -->

The app includes the following views:

* A login page
* A list of upcoming launches
* A detail view for an individual launch
* A user profile page
* A cart

## Prerequisites

### System requirements

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v8.x or later
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v5.x or later
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) v2.14.1 or later

### Sign up for an AWS account

There are no upfront charges or any term commitments to create an AWS account and signing up gives you immediate access to the AWS Free Tier

<div>
  <Button
    size="large"
    color={colors.primary}
    as={<Link to="https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start" />}
  >
    Create AWS Account
  </Button>
  </div>

## Install and setup the Amplify CLI

The Amplify command line toolchain provides an easy way to provision and manage AWS cloud services for your app.

```bash
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```
Configure the CLI to work with your AWS account by creating an IAM user. Amazon IAM (Identity and Access Management) enables you to manage users and user permissions in AWS. You can create one or more IAM users in your AWS account. By default, Amplify creates a user with `AdministratorAccess` to your account so you can provision resources. The video below demonstrates how to install and configure the Amplify CLI.

```bash
amplify configure
```

## Run the Amplify starter

Now the fun begins! From your preferred development directory, clone [this repository](https://github.com/apollographql/fullstack-tutorial):

<MultiCodeBlock>

```react
amplify init --app https://github.com/amplify/starter-react
```

```ios
amplify init --app https://github.com/amplify/starter-ios
```

```android
amplify init --app https://github.com/amplify/starter-android
```
</MultiCodeBlock>

The repository contains a top level directory called `amplify` that stores your backend definition. During the tutorial you'll add capabilities such as authentication, GraphQL API, storage, and set up authorization rules for the API. As you add features, the `amplify` folder will grow with infrastructure-as-code templates that define your backend stack. Infrastructure-as-code is a best practice way to create a replicable backend stack.

<web-only>
Web: Run the starter on your machine by running `yarn && yarn start`.
</web-only>
<ios>
Mobile: Choose the 'Build' icon on Xcode or Android studio. Once the build completes, run the app in a simulator.
</ios>
