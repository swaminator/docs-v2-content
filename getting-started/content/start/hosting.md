Congratulations! You've successfully built your first app with Amplify! Now that you've built something, it's time to deploy it to the web with Amplify Console!

The Amplify Console provides a Git-based workflow for hosting fullstack serverless web apps with continuous deployment. A fullstack serverless app consists of a backend built with cloud resources such as GraphQL or REST APIs, file and data storage, and a frontend built with single page application frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue, or Gatsby.

## Adding the Project to a Git Repository

In order to take advantage of Amplify Console's CI/CD capabilities, it's best to put our project into a Git repository and connect that to Amplify Console. This enables a lot more functionality than just uploading files for deployment (which is also an option).

First create a new repository with your Git provider of choice, and then from the root of the project run:

```bash

```

## Deploy to Amplify Console

```
amplify add hosting
> Amplify Hosting
```

## Set Up Custom Domain

Opens console to setup CI/CD.
