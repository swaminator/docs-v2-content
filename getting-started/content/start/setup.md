description: Bootstrap a React app and initialize a new Amplify project
---

To set up the project, we'll first create a new React app with [create-react-app](), a CLI tool used to bootstrap a React app using current best practices. We'll then add Amplify and initialize a new project.

## Set Up the React App

From your projects directory, run the following commands:

```bash
npx create-react-app photo-share
cd photo-share
```

This creates a new React app in a directory called `photo-share` and then switches us into that new directory. Now that we're in the root of the project, we can run the app by using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This runs a development server and allows us to see the output generated by the build, you can see the running app by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Set Up Amplify

Now that we have a running React app, it's time to set up Amplify for this app so that we can create the necessary backend services needed to support the app. From the root of the project, run:

```bash
amplify init
```

When you initialize Amplify you'll be prompted for some information about the app:

```bash
Enter a name for the project (photo-share)

# All AWS services you provision for your app are grouped into an "environment"
# A common naming convention is dev, stating, and production
Enter a name for the environment (dev)

# Sometimes the CLI will prompt you to edit a file, it will use this editor to open those files.
Choose your default editor

# Amplify supports JavaScript (Web & React Native), iOS, and Android apps
Choose the type of app that you're building (javascript)

What JavaScript framework are you using (react)

Source directory path (src)

Distribution directory path (build)

Build command (npm build)

Start command (npm start)

# This is the profile you created with the `amplify configure` command in the introduction step.
Do you want to use an AWS profile
```

> Where possible the CLI will infer the proper configuration based on the type of project Amplify is being initialzed in. In this case it knew we are using CRA and provided the proper configuration for type of app, framework, source, distribution, build, and start options.

When you initialize a new Amplify project, a few things happen:

- It creates a top level directory called `amplify` that stores your backend definition. During the tutorial you'll add capabilities such as authentication, GraphQL API, storage, and set up authorization rules for the API. As you add features, the `amplify` folder will grow with infrastructure-as-code templates that define your backend stack. Infrastructure-as-code is a best practice way to create a replicable backend stack.
- It creates a file called `aws-exports.js` in the `src` directory that holds all the configuration for the services you create with Amplify. This is how the Amplify client is able to get the necessary information about your backend services.
- It modifies the `.gitignore` file, adding some generated files to the ignore list

## Configure Amplify

The first step to using Amplify in the client is to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install aws-amplify aws-amplify-react
```

The `aws-amplify` package is the main SDK for working with Amplify in your apps. The `aws-amplify-react` package includes some nice helpers that we'll use as we build the app.

Next, we need to configure Amplify so that we can use the SDK to interact with our backend services. Open up `src/index.js` and add replace it with the following:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import Amplify from "aws-amplify";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";
import * as serviceWorker from "./serviceWorker";
import awsExports from "./aws-exports";

Amplify.configure(awsExports);

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));

// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: https://bit.ly/CRA-PWA
serviceWorker.unregister();
```

And that's all it takes to configure Amplify. As you add or remove categories and make udpates to your backend configuration, the configuration in `aws-exports.js` will update automatically.

## Clean Up Boilerplate

First we'll remove some files we won't be using so we can focus on the parts of the app we'll want to update. To clean up the project a bit, remove the following files:

- `src/App.test.js`
- `src/setupTests.js`
- `src/logo.svg`

Next, in `src/App.js` remove the import for `logo.svg` and the `img` tag in the header.

```javascript
import logo from './logo.svg'
...
<img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
```

After removing the image, run the following command:

```bash
amplify status
```

This will give us the current status of the Amplify project, including the current environment, any categories that have been created (we'll learn about these soon!), and what state those categories are in. It should look similar to this:

```bash
Current Environment: dev

| Category | Resource name | Operation | Provider plugin |
| -------- | ------------- | --------- | --------------- |

```

Now that our React app is set up and Amplify is initialized, we're ready to add authentication in the next step.
