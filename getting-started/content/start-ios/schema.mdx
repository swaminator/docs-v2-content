title: '1. Define a data model'
description: Define your data model and create a GraphQL API to interface with your data 
---

To build the photo album app the first thing we need to do is model our backend data. The GraphQL Transform library provides a simple to use abstraction that helps you quickly create a GraphQL API backed with a NoSQL database (Amazon DynamoDB) in the AWS cloud. In the steps below, we'll set up a GraphQL server that will enforce our schema's structure, and then we'll define the schema itself.


## Set up GraphQL data model

For this app, we have the following requirements:

1. A photo album screen that shows a list of photos
2. Ability to view details on a particular photo

A photo album has a `Photo` and `Album` field. An `Album` can contain many `Photos`

A schema is only useful if our data graph conforms to the schema's structure. Enforcing a schema's structure is one of the core features of **GraphQL Transform**. With the GraphQL Transform, you define your application’s data model using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) and the library handles converting your SDL definition into a set of fully descriptive AWS CloudFormation templates that implement your data model.


From the directory of your app, run `amplify add api` and respond to the prompts like this:

```bash
$ amplify add api 

? Please select from one of the below mentioned services
GraphQL

? Provide API name:
photoalbums

? Choose an authorization type for the API
API_KEY

? Do you have an annotated GraphQL schema? 
No

? Do you want a guided schema creation? 
Yes

? What best describes your project: 
One-to-many relationship (e.g., “Blogs” with “Posts” and “Comments”)

? Do you want to edit the schema now? 
Yes

Please manually edit the file created at /home/ec2-user/environment/photoalbums/amplify/backend/api/photoalbums/schema.graphql

? Press enter to continue
```

This will open your default editor with an example schema. Replace the default schema with what is provided below:

```js:title=amplify/backend/api/photoalbums/schema.graphql
type Album @model{
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    photos: [Photo] @connection(name: "AlbumPhotos")
}

type Photo @model{
    id: ID!
    album: Album @connection(name: "AlbumPhotos")
}
```

Define what `@model` and `@connection` do.

## Save data

Here's how you would mutate data on iOS. Keep in mind this is just an example of how this would be done with a Todo object, we will walk you through how to do this in our own app later on once we have installed the pods and are all set up in Xcode.

```swift
    let todo = Todo(name: "MyTodo", description: "description") // Create an instance of the Model you want to mutate
    _ = Amplify.API.mutate(of: todo, type: .create) { (event) in  // Call Mutate with the model with `create` mutation type. You can also `update` or `delete`
        switch event {
        case .completed(let result):
            switch result {
            case .success(let todo):
                print("Successfully created todo: \(todo)")
            case .failure(let error):
                print("Got failed result with \(error.errorDescription)")
            }
        case .failed(let error):
            print("Got failed event with error \(error)")
        default:
            print("Should never happen")
        }
    }
```

## Query data

This is just an example of how to query data in Swift using the Amplify iOS libraries. We will walk you through how to do it in our own app a bit later on.

```swift
    _ = Amplify.API.query(from: Todo.self, byId: "9FCF5DD5-1D65-4A82-BE76-42CB438607A0") { (event) in
        switch event {
        case .completed(let result):
            switch result {
            case .success(let todo):
                guard let todo = todo else {
                    print("Could not find todo")
                    return
                }
                print("Successfully retrieved todo: \(todo)")
            case .failure(let error):
                print("Got failed result with \(error.errorDescription)")
            }
        case .failed(let error):
            print("Got failed event with error \(error)")
        default:
            print("Should never happen")
        }
    }
```

## Push backend to the cloud

```bash
amplify push
```

As you can see below, you can the resources you are creating in AWS inside the Amplify Console which you can get to anytime just by typing `amplify console` in your bash.

## Add the pod to your podfile

Now that we have created the resource in the cloud, we need to install the Amplify API Plugin so we can take advantage of it in code. Add the following pod to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'AmplifyPlugins/AWSAPIPlugin'
```
Now install the dependencies via Cocoapods

```bash
pod install --repo-update
```
## Add the plugin to App Delegate 

Now in your app delegate, let's add the AWS plugin  so that we can use the API category to make calls to our GraphQL Server that we just created. First add the import statements at the top of the file

```swift
import Amplify
import AmplifyPlugins
```
Then add the following code to your AppDelegate’s `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    let apiPlugin = AWSAPIPlugin(modelRegistration: AmplifyModels())
    do {
        try Amplify.add(plugin: apiPlugin)
        try Amplify.configure()
        print("Amplify initialized")
    } catch {
        print("Failed to configure Amplify \(error)")
    }
    return true
}
```
