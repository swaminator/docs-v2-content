## Add storage to your backend

Let's add storage to our backend now. Run the following command in your terminal, answering the follow up questions like so:

```
amplify add storage
? Who should have access: Auth and guest users


? What kind of access do you want for Authenticated users? 
◉ create/update
◉ read
◉ delete


? What kind of access do you want for Guest users? 
◯ create/update
◉ read
◯ delete


? Do you want to add a Lambda Trigger for your S3 Bucket? No
```

## Update your data model

Now let's update our data model to account for our new S3 bucket created in the cloud.

```js:amplify/backend/api/photoalbums/schema.graphql

type Album @model @auth(rules: [{allow: owner}]) {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    photos: [Photo] @connection(name: "AlbumPhotos")
}

type Photo @model @auth(rules: [{allow: owner}]) {
    id: ID!
    album: Album @connection(name: "AlbumPhotos")
    bucket: String!
    fullsize: PhotoS3Info!
    thumbnail: PhotoS3Info!
}

type PhotoS3Info {
    key: String!
    width: Int!
    height: Int!
}
```

```
amplify push
```

## Update Podfile

Now we need to add the storage plugin to our podfile so that we can use it in our app. Update your Podfile with the following pod:

```ruby
pod 'AmplifyPlugins/AWSS3StoragePlugin'
```
Now make sure you run the following command in your terminal to install the dependency:

```bash
pod install --repo-update
```

## Update App Delegate

Now we need to initialize the plugin just like we did with the API category so let's head to our `AppDelegate` file and update the application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method once again:

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    let apiPlugin = AWSAPIPlugin(modelRegistration: AmplifyModels())
    let storagePlugin = AWSS3StoragePlugin() //add this line
    do {
        try Amplify.add(plugin: apiPlugin)
        try Amplify.add(plugin: storagePlugin) //and this one
        try Amplify.configure()
        print("Amplify initialized")
    } catch {
        print("Failed to configure Amplify \(error)")
    }
    return true
}
```

## Use cases

Now we can use it in code and store photos to our albums! The following are examples of how to implement the uses cases in code

### Upload

To upload to S3 from a data object, specify the key and the data object to be uploaded.

```swift
func uploadData() {
    let dataString = "My Data"
    let data = dataString.data(using: .utf8)!
    Amplify.Storage.uploadData(key: "myKey", data: data) { (event) in
        switch event {
        case .completed(let data):
            print("Completed: \(data)")
        case .failed(let storageError):
            print("Failed: \(storageError.errorDescription). \(storageError.recoverySuggestion)")
        case .inProcess(let progress):
            print("Progress: \(progress)")
        default:
            break
        }
    }
}
```
When you have a file that you want to upload, you can specify the url to the file in the local parameter.

```swift

func uploadFile() {
  let dataString = "My Data"
  let fileNameKey = "myFile.txt"
  let filename = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)[0].appendingPathComponent(fileNameKey)
  do {
      try dataString.write(to: filename, atomically: true, encoding: String.Encoding.utf8)
  } catch {
      print("Failed to write to file \(error)")
  }

  _ = Amplify.Storage.uploadFile(key: fileNameKey, local: filename) { (event) in
      switch event {
      case .completed(let data):
          print("Completed: \(data)")
      case .failed(let storageError):
          print("Failed: \(storageError.errorDescription). \(storageError.recoverySuggestion)")
      case .inProcess(let progress):
          print("Progress: \(progress)")
      default:
          break
      }
  }
}
```

### Download

If you uploaded the data at key `myKey` like in the previous example, you can retrieve the data using `Amplify.Storage.downloadData` or download to file with `Amplify.Storage.downloadFile`

```swift
func download() {
  Amplify.Storage.downloadData(key: "myKey") { (event) in
      switch event {
      case .completed(let data):
          print("Completed: \(data)")
      case .failed(let storageError):
          print("Failed: \(storageError.errorDescription). \(storageError.recoverySuggestion)")
      case .inProcess(let progress):
          print("Progress: \(progress)")
      default:
          break
      }
  }

  let downloadToFileName = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)[0].appendingPathComponent("myFile.txt")
  Amplify.Storage.downloadFile(key: "myFile.txt", local: downloadToFileName) { (event) in
      switch event {
      case .completed:
          print("Completed")
      case .failed(let storageError):
          print("Failed: \(storageError.errorDescription). \(storageError.recoverySuggestion)")
      case .inProcess(let progress):
          print("Progress: \(progress)")
      default:
          break
      }
  }
}
```

### List 

You can list out all of the objects uploaded with the following code:

```swift
func list() {
  Amplify.Storage.list { (event) in
      switch event {
      case .completed(let listResult):
          print("Completed")
          listResult.items.forEach { (item) in
              print("Key: \(item.key)")
          }
      case .failed(let storageError):
          print("Failed: \(storageError.errorDescription). \(storageError.recoverySuggestion)")
      case .inProcess(let progress):
          print("Progress: \(progress)")
      default:
          break
      }
  }
}
```
There are many more use cases you can take advantage of with the storage plugin, refer to the docs [here](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/ios/storage).
