title: '3. Set up Authorization Rules'
description: Authorization rules for your GraphQL API

## Authorization

Authorization is required for applications to interact with your GraphQL API. There are a few ways to do this with the AWS API Plugin:
- API Keys
    - API Keys are best used for public APIs (or parts of your schema which you wish to be public) or prototyping, and you must specify the expiration time before deploying. 
- IAM Authorization
    - IAM authorization uses Signature Version 4 to make request with policies attached to Roles. 
- OIDC tokens provided by Amazon Cognito User Pools or 3rd party OpenID Connect providers.
    - OIDC tokens provided by Amazon Cognito User Pools or 3rd party OpenID Connect providers can also be used for authorization, and simply enabling this provides a simple access control requiring users to authenticate to be granted top level access to API actions. 

You can set finer grained access controls using @auth on your schema which leverages authorization metadata provided as part of these tokens or set on the database items themselves.

Your authorization mode choice is inferred from the `amplifyconfiguration.json` file when you call `Amplify.configure()`.

When we set up auth in the previous section, it should have automatically set this up for us but just in case it didn't you can check your `amplifyconfiguration.json` and `awsconfiguration.json` files to make sure they look like the ones below:


```json:title=awsconfiguration.json
{
  "CognitoUserPool": {
        "Default": {
            "PoolId": "POOL-ID",
            "AppClientId": "APP-CLIENT-ID",
            "AppClientSecret": "APP-CLIENT-SECRET",
            "Region": "us-east-1"
        }
    },
  "AppSync": {
        "Default": {
            "ApiUrl": "YOUR-GRAPHQL-ENDPOINT",
            "Region": "us-east-1",
            "AuthMode": "AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS"
        }
   }
}
```

```json:title=amplifyconfiguration.json
{
    ...
    "awsAPIPlugin": {
        "<YOUR-GRAPHQLENDPOINT-NAME": {
            "endpointType": "GraphQL",
            "endpoint": "YOUR-GRAPHQL-ENDPOINT",
            "region": "us-west-2",
            "authorizationType": "AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS",
        }
    }
}
```
