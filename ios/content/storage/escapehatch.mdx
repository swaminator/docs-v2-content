title: Escape Hatch
description: Use the Amazon S3 SDK via escape hatch
---

For advanced use cases where Amplify does not provide the functionality, you can retrieve the escape hatch to access the AWSS3 instance.

Add `import AmplifyPlugins` and then the following code:

```swift
func getEscapeHatch() {
  do {
      let plugin = try Amplify.Storage.getPlugin(for: "awsS3StoragePlugin") as! AWSS3StoragePlugin
      let awsS3 = plugin.getEscapeHatch()
      XCTAssertNotNil(awsS3)
  } catch {
      XCTFail("Failed to get AWSS3 instance")
  }
}
```
