description: Get started with Storage category in Amplify
---

The Amplify CLI helps you to create and configure the storage buckets for your app. The Amplify AWS S3 Storage plugin leverages [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3).

**Prerequisites:**
* An iOS project targeting at least iOS 11.0.
* Install and configure the Amplify CLI

```terminal
$ npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
$ amplify configure
```

## Set up your backend

Go to your project directory and run the following commands to get a fully functioning backend with the Storage category:

Run `amplify init` command as shown:

```terminal
$ amplify init
? Enter a name for the project AmplifyStorage
? Enter a name for the environment dev
? Choose your default editor: Visual Studio Code
? Choose the type of app that you're building ios
? Do you want to use an AWS profile? Yes
? Please choose the profile you want to use default
```

## Add Storage

Add storage using the command `amplify add storage`. Here is an example:

```terminal
$ amplify add storage
? Please select from one of the below mentioned services: `Content (Images, audio, video, etc.)`
? You need to add auth (Amazon Cognito) to your project in order to add storage for user files. Do you want to add auth now? `Yes`
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration? `Default configuration`
? How do you want users to be able to sign in? `Username`
? Do you want to configure advanced settings? `No, I am done.`
? Please provide a friendly name for your resource that will be used to label this category in the project: `S3friendlyName`
? Please provide bucket name: `storagebucketName`
? Who should have access: `Auth and guest users`
? What kind of access do you want for Authenticated users? `create/update, read, delete`
? What kind of access do you want for Guest users? `create/update, read, delete`
? Do you want to add a Lambda Trigger for your S3 Bucket? `No`
```

Push your changes to the cloud using the push command.
```terminal
$ amplify push
```

When your backend is successfully provisioned, there should be two new generated files : `amplifyconfiguration.json` and `awsconfiguration.json` in your project folder. We will add these files to your project in a later step.

Run `amplify console storage` to open the AWS S3 console in a web browser.

## Install Amplify libraries

If this is a new project, run `pod init` from the root of your application folder to create the `Podfile` to use CocoaPods to manage your dependencies. Add the following to the `Podfile`

```ruby
target :'YOUR-APP-NAME' do
use_frameworks!
    pod 'AmplifyPlugins/AWSS3StoragePlugin'
    pod 'AWSMobileClient', '~> 2.12.0'
end
```

Close out of the existing Xcode project if you have it open.

Install the dependencies via CocoaPods
```ruby
pod install --repo-update
```

Open the `.xcworkspace` file created by CocoaPods
```ruby
open <YOURAPP>.xcworkspace
```
## Add configuration files

1. Open the finder of your project and drag the `amplifyconfiguration.json` and `awsconfiguration.json` over to the Xcode window, under the workspace. 
2. Enable `Copy items if needed` if not already enabled
3. For "Added folders", have `Create groups` selected. 
4. For "Add to targets", make sure the app target is checked off.
5. Build (`CMD+B`) the app 

## Initialize Amplify

Initialize `AWSMobileClient`, `Amplify`, and `AWSS3StoragePlugin`.

Add the following imports to the top of your `AppDelegate.swift` file
    ```swift
    import Amplify
    import AWSMobileClient
    import AmplifyPlugins
    ```
Add the following code to your AppDelegate's `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method

    ```swift
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        // Override point for customization after application launch.

        AWSMobileClient.default().initialize { (userState, error) in
            guard error == nil else {
                print("Error initializing AWSMobileClient. Error: \(error!.localizedDescription)")
                return
            }
            print("AWSMobileClient initialized, userstate: \(userState)")
        }

        let storagePlugin = AWSS3StoragePlugin()
        do {
            try Amplify.add(plugin: storagePlugin)
            try Amplify.configure()
            print("Amplify configured with storage plugin")
        } catch {
            print("Failed to initialize Amplify with \(error)")
        }

        return true
    }
    ```
