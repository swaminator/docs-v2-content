description: Building GraphQL APIs with Amplify
---

**UPDATE DESCRIPTION HERE** The API category provides a solution for making HTTP requests to REST and GraphQL endpoints. It includes a AWS Signature Version 4 signer class which automatically signs all AWS API requests for you as well as methods to use API Keys, Amazon Cognito User Pools, or 3rd party OIDC providers.

## Client integration


You can use any HTTP or GraphQL client to connect to a GraphQL API on AppSync. We do recommend using the Amplify clients which are optimized to connect to the AppSync backend. There are some options depending on your application's use case:

For DynamoDB data sources, use the DataStore category in the Amplify client. It provides the best developer experience and built-in conflict detection and resolution.
For non-DynamoDB data sources in scenarios where you have no offline requirements, use the API (GraphQL) category in the Amplify client.
For non-DynamoDB data sources in scenarios where you have offline requirements, use the AppSync SDK.
