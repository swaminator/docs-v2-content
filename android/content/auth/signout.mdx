## Sign-out

```javascript
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

Auth.signOut()
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(err => console.log(err));
```

## Global sign-out

By doing this, you are revoking all the auth tokens (id token, access token and refresh token) which means the user is signed out from all the devices
Note: although the tokens are revoked, the AWS credentials will remain valid until they expire (which by default is 1 hour)

```js
Auth.signOut({ global: true })
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(err => console.log(err));
```
