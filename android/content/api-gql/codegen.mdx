## Running code generator

1. In `amplifyxc.config`, enable model generation, and save the file.
    ```ruby
    modelgen=true
    ```
2. Build (`CMD+B`). This will generate the Model files to be used with `Amplify.API` to query, mutate, and subscribe to you AppSync service. After build completes, the model files will be generated under `amplify/generated/models`. When you edit the schema under `amplify/backend/api/<APINAME>/schema.graphql` and build, it will regenerate the Model files.

3. Alternatively, you can run `amplify codegen models` using Amplify CLI. Make sure you set `modelgen=false` if you are using the CLI instead of Amplify Tools.

3. Drag the entire `models` directory over to your project. If you Build the project, the model files will be regenerated under the `amplify` folder. 
4. Select each model file, and select the app under Target Membership, to make sure it gets added to the target when building the app.

6. Register the models before initializing Amplify in your AppDelegate method.
    ```
    ModelRegistry.register(modelType: Todo.self)
    ```
Make sure it builds and runs (`CMD+R`) successfully before moving onto the next section.
