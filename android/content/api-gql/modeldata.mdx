## Understanding types

## GraphQL schema

## Complex objects

## Directives

## Named Connections

The name argument specifies a name for the connection and itâ€™s used to create bi-directional relationships that reference the same underlying foreign key.

For example, if you wanted your `Post.comments` and `Comment.post` fields to refer to opposite sides of the same relationship, you need to provide a name.

```
type Blog @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  posts: [Post] @connection(name: "BlogPosts")
}

type Post @model {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  blog: Blog! @connection(name: "BlogPosts")
}
```
Will generate the Models with 
```
public struct Blog: Model {
...
  public var posts: List<Post>?
  ...
}
public struct Post: Model {
...
  public var blog: Blog
  ...
}
```
