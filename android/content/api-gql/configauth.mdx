## Authorization Modes

For client authorization AppSync supports API Keys, Amazon IAM credentials, Amazon Cognito User Pools, and 3rd party OIDC providers. This is inferred from the `amplifyconfiguration.json` file when you call `Amplify.congifure()`.


### API Key

API Key is the easiest way to setup and prototype your application with AppSync. 

**The above content needs to be beefed up. This provides no value to the customer**

### Cognito User Pool

Amazon Cognito User Pools is the most common service to use with AppSync when adding user Sign-Up and Sign-In to your 
application. If your application needs to interact with other AWS services besides AppSync, such as S3, you will need to 
use IAM credentials with Cognito Identity Pools. The Amplify CLI can automatically configure this for you when running 
`amplify add auth` and can also automatically federate User Pools with Identity Pools. This allows you to have 
both User Pool credentials for AppSync and AWS credentials for S3. You can then use the `AWSMobileClient` for automatic 
credentials refresh [as outlined in the authentication section](./authentication). 

For manual configuration, add the 
following snippet to your `awsconfiguration.json` file:


```json
{
  "CognitoUserPool": {
        "Default": {
            "PoolId": "POOL-ID",
            "AppClientId": "APP-CLIENT-ID",
            "AppClientSecret": "APP-CLIENT-SECRET",
            "Region": "us-east-1"
        }
    },
  "AppSync": {
        "Default": {
            "ApiUrl": "YOUR-GRAPHQL-ENDPOINT",
            "Region": "us-east-1",
            "AuthMode": "AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS"
        }
   }
}
```

and your `amplifyconfiguration.json` file, under the `awsAPIPlugin`
```json
{
    ...
    "awsAPIPlugin": {
        "<YOUR-GRAPHQLENDPOINT-NAME": {
            "endpointType": "GraphQL",
            "endpoint": "YOUR-GRAPHQL-ENDPOINT",
            "region": "us-west-2",
            "authorizationType": "AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS",
        }
    }
}

```
Add the following code to your app:

```swift                                
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        // Override point for customization after application launch.
        AWSMobileClient.default().initialize { (userState, error) in
            guard error == nil else {
                print("Error initializing AWSMobileClient. Error: \(error!.localizedDescription)")
                return
            }
            guard let userState = userState else {
                print("userState is unexpectedly empty initializing AWSMobileClient")
                return
            }

            print("AWSMobileClient initialized, userstate: \(userState)")
        }

        // Amplify section
        let apiPlugin = AWSAPIPlugin()
        try! Amplify.add(plugin: apiPlugin)
        try! Amplify.configure()
        print("Amplify initialized")

        return true
    }
```

### IAM

When using AWS IAM in a mobile application you should leverage Amazon Cognito Identity Pools. The Amplify CLI can automatically configure this for you when running `amplify add auth`. You can then use the `AWSMobileClient` for automatic credentials refresh [as outlined in the authentication section](./authentication) For manual configuration, add the following snippet to your `awsconfiguration.json` file:

```json
{
  "CredentialsProvider": {
      "CognitoIdentity": {
          "Default": {
              "PoolId": "YOUR-COGNITO-IDENTITY-POOLID",
              "Region": "us-east-1"
          }
      }
  } 
}
```

and your `amplifyconfiguration.json` file, under the `awsAPIPlugin`
```json
{
    ...
    "awsAPIPlugin": {
        "<YOUR-GRAPHQLENDPOINT-NAME": {
            "endpointType": "GraphQL",
            "endpoint": "YOUR-GRAPHQL-ENDPOINT",
            "region": "us-west-2",
            "authorizationType": "API_IAM",
        }
    }
}
```

### OIDC

If you are using a 3rd party OIDC provider you will need to configure it and manage the details of token refreshes yourself. Update the `amplifyconfiguration.json` file and code snippet as follows:

```json
{
    ...
    "awsAPIPlugin": {
        "<YOUR-GRAPHQLENDPOINT-NAME": {
            "endpointType": "GraphQL",
            "endpoint": "YOUR-GRAPHQL-ENDPOINT",
            "region": "us-west-2",
            "authorizationType": "OPENID_CONNECT",
        }
    }
}
```

Add the following code to your app:

```swift
public class MyOidcURLRequestInterceptor: URLRequestInterceptor {

    public func intercept(_ request: URLRequest) throws -> URLRequest {
        guard let mutableRequest = (request as NSURLRequest).mutableCopy() as? NSMutableURLRequest else {
            throw APIError.unknown("Could not get mutable request", "")
        }
        mutableRequest.setValue(NSDate().aws_stringValue(AWSDateISO8601DateFormat2), forHTTPHeaderField: "X-Amz-Date")
        mutableRequest.setValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
        mutableRequest.setValue("amplify-ios/0.0.1 Amplify", forHTTPHeaderField: "User-Agent")

        let token = "MyToken"
        mutableRequest.setValue(token, forHTTPHeaderField: "authorization")
        return mutableRequest as URLRequest
    }
}

do {
    // Initialize Amplify with the interceptor
    let apiPlugin = AWSAPIPlugin()
    do {
        try Amplify.add(plugin: apiPlugin)
        try Amplify.configure()
        print("Amplify initialized")
        let interceptor = MyOidcURLRequestInterceptor()
        try Amplify.API.add(interceptor: interceptor, for: "<YOUR-GRAPHQENDPOINT-NAME>")
    } catch {
        print("Failed to configure Amplify \(error)")
    }
} catch {
    print("Error initializing appsync client. \(error)")
}
```

## Multi-Auth

This section talks about the capability of AWS AppSync to configure multiple authorization modes for a single AWS AppSync endpoint and region. Follow the [AWS AppSync Multi-Auth](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security.html#using-additional-authorization-modes) to configure multiple authorization modes for your AWS AppSync endpoint.

You can now configure a single GraphQL API to deliver private and public data. Private data requires authenticated access using authorization mechanisms such as IAM, Cognito User Pools, and OIDC. Public data does not require authenticated access and is delivered through authorization mechanisms such as API Keys. You can also configure a single GraphQL API to deliver private data using more than one authorization type. For example, you can configure your GraphQL API  to authorize some schema fields using OIDC, while other schema fields through Cognito User Pools and/or IAM.

As discussed in the above linked documentation, certain fields may be protected by different authorization types. This can lead the same query, mutation, or subscription to have different responses based on the authorization sent with the request; Therefore, it is recommended to use the different `friendly_name_<AuthMode>` as the `apiName` parameter in the `Amplify.API` call to reference each authorization type.

The following snippets highlight the new values in the `amplifyconfiguration.json` and the client code configurations.

The `friendly_name` illustrated here is created from Amplify CLI prompt. There are 4 clients in this configuration that connect to the same API except that they use different `AuthMode`.

```json
{
    "UserAgent": "aws-amplify-cli/2.0",
    "Version": "1.0",
    "api": {
        "plugins": {
            "awsAPIPlugin": {
                "friendly_name_API_KEY": {
                    "endpointType": "GraphQL",
                    "endpoint": "https://xyz.appsync-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graphql",
                    "region": "us-west-2",
                    "authorizationType": "API_KEY",
                    "apiKey": "da2-abcdefghijklmnopqr"
                },
                "friendly_name_AWS_IAM": {
                    "endpointType": "GraphQL",
                    "endpoint": "https://xyz.appsync-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graphql",
                    "region": "us-west-2",
                    "authorizationType": "API_KEY",
                },
                "friendly_name_AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS": {
                    "endpointType": "GraphQL",
                    "endpoint": "https://xyz.appsync-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graphql",
                    "region": "us-west-2",
                    "authorizationType": "AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS",
                },
                "friendly_name_OPENID_CONNECT": {
                    "endpointType": "GraphQL",
                    "endpoint": "https://xyz.appsync-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graphql",
                    "region": "us-west-2",
                    "authorizationType": "OPENID_CONNECT",
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```swift
Amplify.API.mutate(apiName: "friendly_name_API_KEY" ...)
```
