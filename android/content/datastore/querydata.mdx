## Query Data

Querying data is always against the locally synchronized data, which is updated in the background for you by the DataStore Sync Engine when connected to the cloud. You can query using models as well as conditions using predicate filters for finer grained results.

```swift
  Amplify.DataStore.query(Post.self){
        switch $0 {
        case .success(let result):
          print("Posts: \(result)")   //result will be of type [Post]
        case .failure(let err):
         print("Error listing posts - \(err.localizedDescription)")
      }
}
```

## Query with Predicates

You can apply predicate filters against the DataStore using the fields defined on your GraphQL type along with the following conditions supported by DynamoDB:

**Strings:** `eq | ne | le | lt | ge | gt | contains | notContains | beginsWith | between`

**Numbers:** `eq | ne | le | lt | ge | gt | between`

**Lists:** `contains | notContains`

This is done via `Amplify.DataStore.query(<Model>, where:{})`. The `where` statement is a closure which accepts predicates compatible with the operators listed above. For example if you wanted all of the Posts with rating greater than 4:

```swift
let p = Post.keys
Amplify.DataStore.query(Post.self, where: { p.rating > 4 }){
    switch $0 {
    case .success(let result):
      print("Posts: \(result)")
    case .failure(let err):
      print("Error listing posts - \(err.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```

You can build upon this with more complex `where` statements using Swift operators such as `||`, `&&`, etc:

```swift
let p = Post.keys
Amplify.DataStore.query(Post.self, where: { p.rating > 4 || p.status == "active" }){
    switch $0 {
    case .success(let result):
      print("Posts: \(result)")
    case .failure(let err):
      print("Error listing posts - \(err.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```

You can also write this in a compositional function manner by replacing the operators with their equivalent predicate statements such as `.gt`, `.or`, etc:

```swift
let p = Post.keys
Amplify.DataStore.query(Post.self, where: { p.rating.gt(4).or(p.status.eq("active")) }){
    //...more code
}
```
