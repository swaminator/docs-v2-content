To view this information in the terminal, run:

```ruby
amplify console analytics
```

To view this from the AWS Console for pinpoint:

1. Navigate to the AWS Console for Pinpoint.
2. Under Analytics, click on Events. 
3. Enable filters, you can select `Session Start` and `Session Stop` events to filter on session events.
