## Record Event

The Amplify Analytics plugin makes it easy to record custom events within the app. The plugin handles retry logic in the event the device looses network connectivity and automatically batches requests to reduce network bandwidth.

```swift
func recordEvents() {
    let properties = ["eventPropertyStringKey": "eventProperyStringValue",
                      "eventPropertyIntKey": 123,
                      "eventPropertyDoubleKey": 12.34,
                      "eventPropertyBoolKey": true] as [String: AnalyticsPropertyValue]
    let event = BasicAnalyticsEvent("eventName", properties: properties)
    Amplify.Analytics.record(event: event)

    // Plugin will automatically flush events. 
    // You do not have to do this in the app code.
    Amplify.Analytics.flushEvents() 
}
```

## Flush Events

Events have default configuration to flush out to the network every 60 seconds. If you would like to change this, update `amplifyconfiguration.json` with the value you would like for `autoFlushEventsInterval` like so
```json
{
    "UserAgent": "aws-amplify-cli/2.0",
    "Version": "1.0",
    "analytics": {
        "plugins": {
            "awsPinpointAnalyticsPlugin": {
                "pinpointAnalytics": {
                    "appId": "AppID",
                    "region": "Region"
                },
                "pinpointTargeting": {
                    "region": "Region"
                },
                "autoFlushEventsInterval": 60
            }
        }
    }
}
```
If you do set `autoFlushEventsInterval` to 0, you are responsible for calling `Amplify..flushEvents()` to flush events.


## Global Properties

You can register properties which will be used across all `Amplify.Analytics.record`.

```swift
let globalProperties = ["globalPropertyKey": "value"] as [String: AnalyticsPropertyValue]
Amplify.Analytics.registerGlobalProperties(globalProperties)
```

To unregister all global properties, simply call `Amplify.Analytics.unregisterGlobalProperties()` or to unregister a single property, use
```swift
Amplify.Analytics.unregisterGlobalProperties(["globalPropertyKey"])

## Disable Analytics

To disable analytics, call:
```swift
Amplify.Analytics.disable()
```

## Enable Analytics

To enable analytics, call:
```swift
Amplify.Analytics.enable()
```
